My general idea here is to wrap OSTree in a simpler API that doesn't use any of the
GObject, GLib, Gio, etc. data structures. This should allow users (the weldr team)
to be able to write ffi bindings in Rust and Haskell without too much trouble.

Functionality will be limited to what we need for the project, and won't be a 1:1
mapping of libOSTree's API, instead it will be higher level functions using basic
C data types.

Use a simple Makefile to build this, depend on pkg-config for the ostree
library flags and includes.
